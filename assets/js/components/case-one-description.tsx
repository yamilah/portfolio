            Houseparty is a face-to-face social network focuses on instant video chats of up to 8 people. I really loved working on this oneâ€”it was a short timeline, but I had a ton of fun working with the problems synchronous communication tends to require. You used to be able to check it out at <a href="https://app.houseparty.com" className="case-one-desc-text-link">app.houseparty.com</a>, and you'd be running my code! But no longer. I was the only designer and front-end developer on the team, but there were two other devs, a CTO, and the lead PM at the company. We had a little over three months. Also, I was designing along with the mobile side of this, so there was a ton of work to do that overlapped with the mobile experience. This took about three months.
